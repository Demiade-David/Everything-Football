           <strong> Remarks From The Author About The Arsenal Match.</strong>
            <details>
      I personally thought that Arsenal would win that match no stress but Psg shocked me.
      A team that could beat Real Madrid 5-1 in aggregate, I thought the victory was sure.
      I have never been more wrong and now PSG advance to the finals.

           <strong> About The Barcelona Match.</strong>
            <details>
Barcelona really fell my hands when they lost but they cannot be blamed their star striker,
Robert Lewandowski didn't play. Don't get me wrong I loved the match so many highlights and 
goals. But I was really expecting Barcelona to win. But good job to the Barcelona players,
you guys did well.
